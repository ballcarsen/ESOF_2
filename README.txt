The authors of this project are Carsen Ball and Mitchell Black.

Our program will prompt to select one of the Math softwares: Mathematica, MTool, or MyMath.
The program will then print an unsorted array, sort the array with the chosen Math software,
and print the sorted array. The program then switches to a different Math software
and sorts an array using that software.

Our program can be complied by running "make". The executable program is named "HW2".
